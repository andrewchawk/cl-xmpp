- respect stringprep/nodeprep  -  jid validator

- sasl/tls

- don't like xmlns and query ids as strings
 - also, i'm interning things which will screw up lisps with up/down
   case different.

- ok, test receive-stanza-loop with a file with contents
  which i think i'm getting and see if it blows up with
  that.
