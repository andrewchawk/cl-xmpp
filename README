This is a Common Lisp implementation of the XMPP RFCs.  The 
implementation is currently very immature and comments are
solicited.

Non-normative example:

* (defparameter *c* (xmpp:connect :hostname "my-xmpp-server"))
#<CONNECTION open>

* (xmpp:begin-xml-stream *c*)
... output ...

* (xmpp:auth *c* "username" "password" "resource")
... output ...

* (xmpp:receive-stanzas *c*)
... output ...

* (xmpp:message *c* "username" "message")
... output ...

; let's assume a user replies to you
* (xmpp:receive-stanzas *c*)
(#<MESSAGE>)

And so on and so forth.  Check cl-xmpp.lisp and package.lisp for
symbols which are exported and might be of use.
